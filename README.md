# Code Refactor Starter Code
User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


When you view the source code, you find the semantic HTML elements.
Examples are: header, main, and footer. The main tag has two section: the first is content, the second is benefits.

When you view the structure of the HTML elements, you will find those elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
For example: we have nav in header and we style the nav in css. We also have both an unorder list and links in the nav. So we are styling the nav-li class and nav-a class.

When you view the image attributes, you will find accessible alt attributes.
Example: our background image (class="hero" role="img" aria-label="{background-image}")
or: our online reputation management image(alt="online reputation management")

When you view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order.

When you view the title element, you find a concise, descriptive title: seo.
