# Code Refactor Starter Code
User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


when you view the source code, then you find semantic HTML elements;
exsample: header, main, footer. have two section in main. the first one is content, the second is benefits.

when you view the structure of the HTML elements, then you find that elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
exsample: we have nav in header. we styling the nav in css. we have unorder list and link in nav. so we styling nav-li class and nav-a class;

when you view the image attributes, then you find accessible alt attributes.
exsample: our background image( <div class="hero" role="img" aria-label="{background-image}"></div>)
or: our online reputation management image(<img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" alt="online reputation management" class="float-right" />)

when you view the heading attributes,then they fall in sequential order.

when you view the title element, then you find a concise,descriptive title: seo.
